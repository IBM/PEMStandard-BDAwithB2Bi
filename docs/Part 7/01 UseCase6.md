The premise of this use case involves a Sponsor company, able to dictate the structure / EDI rules / EDI implementation guide that their partner(s) must conform to.

In this simple use case, the Sponsor company rolls out the EDI compliance check PEM activity to a new partner they’re looking to onboard. Once rolled out, the partner downloads the Sponsor company’s EDI implementation guide(s), creates a file that they believe conforms to the EDI implementation guide, then uploads a test file to verify whether file conforms to the EDI implementation guide.

The first file uploaded by the new partner intentially fails compliance and the PEM activity identifies where the error within the uploaded file exists. The partner subsequently corrects the non-compliant EDI file and uploads a corrected EDI file that conforms to the Implementation guide and gets confirmation from the PEM compliance check activity.
